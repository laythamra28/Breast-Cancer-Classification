# Breast Cancer Classification using PyTorch

## Depenc

## Project Description

This is a final project I did for my Deep Learning class at Boston Univeristy. The project consists of choosing a biological dataset and creating multiple different neural networks using PyTorch to compare metrics. The dataset was sourced from kaggle and consisted of greyscale 480x640 JPG images of labeled and segmented MRI scans of breast cancer patints that are healthy and sick. After the data was downloaded, the data had to be converted from JPG images to a matrix consiting

## Dataset

The Dataset is JPG images of labeled MRI scans from breast cancer patients that are healthy and sick. The data was provided by Kaggle at this link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uzairkhan45/breast-cancer-patients-data

The Data looks like this:
