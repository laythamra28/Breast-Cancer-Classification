# Breast Cancer Classification using PyTorch


## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to compare the metrics of 3 different neural network architectures on classifying segmented MRI scans of breast cancer patints that are healthy and sick. The 3 networks that were choosen are: AlexNet, VGG, and LeNet. The project was coded using Google collab notebooks and Pytorch was used to create the neural networks. Hyperparamter tuning was also performed on the network with the best accruacy to explore the possibilty of increasing accuracy. This project provides a great framework for people thinking of doing a personal deep learning project.



## Dataset

The dataset was sourced from kaggle and consisted of greyscale 480x640 JPG images of  labeled MRI scans from breast cancer patients that are healthy and sick.  After the
