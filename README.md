# Breast Cancer Classification using CNN's

This is a final project I did for my Deep Learning class at Boston Univeristy. The project consists of choosing a biological dataset and creating multiple different neural networks using PyTorch to compare metrics.

## Dataset

The Dataset is JPG images of labeled MRI scans from breast cancer patients are healthy and sick. The Data was provided by Kaggle at this link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uzairkhan45/breast-cancer-patients-data
