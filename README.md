# Breast Cancer Classification using CNN's

This is a final project I did for my Deep Learning class at Boston Univeristy. The project consists of choosing a biological dataset and comparing metrics of different neural network architectures. 

## Dataset

The Dataset is JPG images of MRI scans from patients that were sick with Breast cancer and healthy patients. The Data was retreived from Kaggle at this link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uzairkhan45/breast-cancer-patients-data
